# # 01 — Atomic synchronization: fault-injection consistency test
#
# ## In plain language
#
# **The question:** if your array data (Zarr) lives in one place and a *separate*
# index describing it (e.g. a STAC catalog) lives somewhere else, can the two ever
# disagree — say, right after a crash, or when two jobs write at the same time?
#
# **The answer this notebook produces the evidence for:** with a separate index, yes
# — every one of the four situations below produced an observable mismatch, every
# time we ran it. With **Icechunk**, which commits the array data and its metadata
# together as a single atomic transaction, no mismatch was ever observed — in any of
# the four situations, including against a real cloud object store.
#
# **The four situations, as everyday stories:**
#
# | Code name | What it tests (technical) | What it means in practice |
# |---|---|---|
# | **F1** | crash *after* the data is written, *before* the catalog is updated | Your script crashes partway through a routine update. The new data is sitting on disk, but the catalog still describes the *old* version — so anyone reading the catalog right now gets pointed at data that has since changed underneath them. |
# | **F2** | crash *after* the catalog is updated, *before* the data is written | Your script crashes the other way around. The catalog now promises a version of the data that doesn't exist on disk yet — a reader following it hits something missing or wrong. |
# | **F3** | a reader arrives while a write is still in progress | Someone opens the dataset *while* you're halfway through updating it. They don't cleanly get "the old version" or "the new version" — they can see a mix: new data paired with the old description, or vice versa. |
# | **F4** | two writers racing to update the same data at the same time | Two jobs — two pipeline runs, or you and a colleague — update the same dataset at once. Without protection, one silently overwrites the other and the loser's work just vanishes: no error, no warning, no trace. |
#
# **Claim under test (technical):** Icechunk-backed transactional stores produce zero
# observable metadata–data inconsistencies under writer failure and concurrent access,
# whereas disconnected STAC metadata indexes over object storage produce such
# inconsistencies without external orchestration.
#
# **Method:** A fault-injection harness generates synthetic Zarr arrays carrying a
# SHA-256 checksum attribute. A consistency checker recomputes the checksum from the
# data and compares it against the checksum recorded in the metadata — a mismatch is
# an observable inconsistency. Faults are injected at specific points in the write
# sequence across four scenarios (F1-F4) for three systems (Icechunk, STAC B0 "naive",
# STAC B1 "best-effort with a cleanup sweeper"), on a local-filesystem backend and a
# real S3-compatible object store (NIRD/Sigma2).
#
# **Status:** executed. The results below come from a real run — 1000 trials per
# scenario × system on the local-filesystem backend, plus 100 trials per scenario for
# Icechunk against the NIRD/Sigma2 object store (the environment where the
# conditional-write/CAS guarantee actually matters; see Section 3). The numbers are
# also reported in `nanopubs/drafts/05_outcome.md`.

# ## 3. Figure: inconsistency count per scenario × system
#
# Design:
# - **Panels 1–3 (local filesystem, N=1000)**: Icechunk vs STAC B0/B1 across F1/F2/F3.
#   - **F1 B1**: plotted as two adjacent real bars — pre-sweep and post-sweep
#     (1000 → 0), each independently labelled. Both values are plotted, not just
#     the pre-sweep count with an annotation arrow that's easy to miss.
#   - **F2 B1**: cross-hatched — this is a measured F2-state check (is STAC ever ahead
#     of data?), not a fault injection. Zero is real but means "write-ordering holds".
#   - **Y-axis**: worst-case trial count (deterministic injection), not a probability.
# - **Panel 4 (object store, N=100)**: Icechunk-only run against the real NIRD/Sigma2
#   S3-compatible endpoint — the environment the claim is actually about (conditional
#   writes / CAS), where local filesystem gets atomicity "for free" via POSIX rename.
#   F1-F3 here are structural (session-model) checks that pass on any backend; they
#   do not by themselves contest the branch tip. **F4** (concurrent racing writers,
#   see `harness/faults.py`) is the scenario that actually does — it has now been run
#   for real against NIRD/Sigma2 with live `MINIO_*` credentials, and is plotted here as
#   two bars: `conflict_rejected` (the positive control for the conditional-write
#   guarantee — green, expected to equal N) and `inconsistent` (expected zero). This is
#   the evidence the Validated status in `nanopubs/drafts/05_outcome.md` rests on. Panel
#   4 has its own y-scale (N=100 ≠ N=1000) so the bars stay legible.

# ### How to read this figure, in plain language
#
# Every bar is a count of *observable inconsistencies* out of N independent trials —
# lower is better, and 0 means "never seen to break, in this many tries."
#
# **Depending on whether this run had `MINIO_*` credentials, the figure above shows
# either three panels (local filesystem only, saved to
# `figures/main_result_local_only.png`) or four (the committed
# `figures/main_result.png`, which adds the NIRD/Sigma2 object-store run described
# in the last bullet below).** Panels 1-3 are identical either way.
#
# - **Panels 1 and 3 (F1, F3 — local filesystem):** Icechunk stays at 0. Both STAC
#   variants land at N — i.e. *every single trial* produced a detectable mismatch
#   between the catalog and the data.
# - **Panel 1 (F1), STAC B1's two bars — read this one carefully:** the left
#   ("pre-sweep") bar shows N out of N trials inconsistent — exactly as broken as
#   B0 at the moment of the crash. The right ("post-sweep") bar drops to 0 *only
#   because a separate cleanup job (the "sweeper") ran afterwards and fixed it up*.
#   **This is not "B1 solves F1."** It means: *broken at first, repaired later by a
#   cleanup sweep — and in between, there is a real window during which anyone who
#   reads the catalog sees data that doesn't match what it claims.* How long that
#   window stays open depends entirely on how often you remember to run the sweeper.
#   Icechunk has no such window, because there is nothing to sweep: the data and its
#   description either land together or not at all.
# - **Panel 2 (F2 — local filesystem):** the hatched STAC B1 bar at 0 is *not* the
#   same kind of "win" as Icechunk's 0. It means "we checked, and B1's particular
#   write order happens to avoid this one failure mode" — a property of how B1
#   orders its writes, not a guarantee enforced by the storage layer. Change the
#   write order (or the system that writes), and the protection can disappear. F1
#   and F3 still break it regardless.
# - **Panel 4, only present in `figures/main_result.png` (NIRD/Sigma2 — real cloud
#   object store, Icechunk only):** this is
#   the panel that matters most for "does the guarantee hold for real, on the kind
#   of storage people actually use?" F1-F3 read 0, confirming the same all-or-nothing
#   behaviour holds off of a local disk. **F4 is the decisive bar pair**: the green
#   `conflict_rejected` bar landing at 100/100 means that *every single time* two
#   writers raced for the same update, the object store itself refused the loser's
#   write outright — nothing was silently overwritten, and the `inconsistent` bar
#   stays at 0. That refusal is the conditional-write / compare-and-swap guarantee
#   (see the "should you use Icechunk?" box above) working exactly as advertised,
#   measured against a real S3-compatible endpoint rather than assumed.
